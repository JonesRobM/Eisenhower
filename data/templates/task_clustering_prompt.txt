You are analysing task descriptions to identify natural groupings and suggest appropriate category names.

Task descriptions:
{{task_descriptions}}

Current categories:
{{current_categories}}

Instructions:
1. Group similar tasks based on semantic meaning and context
2. Suggest concise, professional category names for new groups
3. Only suggest new categories if there are at least {{min_samples}} similar tasks
4. Use lowercase, hyphenated naming convention (e.g., "skill-development")
5. Avoid overly specific categories that won't generalise

Output format:
{
  "suggested_categories": [
    {
      "name": "category-name",
      "tasks": ["task1", "task2", ...],
      "rationale": "Brief explanation of grouping"
    }
  ]
}
